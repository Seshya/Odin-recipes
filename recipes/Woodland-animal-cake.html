<h4>Description</h4>
<p><em> This Woodland and animal cake is a chocolate sponge cake that is layered with a rich cherry filling and is based on the German dessert Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte, which means “Black Forest Cherry Torte”. It consists of alternating layers of moist chocolate cake and heavenly whipped cream. The cake is soaked in cherry liqueur and filled with juicy black cherries in the middle. This recipe uses a cake mix for ease and convenience but tastes completely homemade.</em></p>
