<h4> Description</h4>
<p><em>Mandazi are amazingly soft donuts very famous in East Africa. They are excellent served with a cup of tea or coffee. Their making involves foaming fresh (or dry) yeast in warm, sweet liquid (milk or water) and then kneading a firm dough and letting it rise. When it has doubled in size, the dough is cut in portions, rounded and gets a short rest, then shaped in to its final form, and deep fried after a longer rise.</em></p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<ul>

<li>4 cups flour</li>
<li>1 cup caster sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dry active yeast</li>
<li>0.5 tsps nutmeg , freshly grated</li>
<li>1.5 cup warm water (35°C or more)</li>
<li>0.5 tsp salt</li>
<li>Vegetable oil</li>

</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>

<ol>

<li>In a large bowl of water, mix 1 tablespoon caster sugar, ½ cup (100 ml) water, and the yeast.</li>
<li>Let the yeast foam for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the flour, nutmeg and remaining sugar.</li>
<li>Mix and dig a well in the center.</li>
<li>Pour the mixture of water, sugar and yeast in the center of this well.</li>
<li>Mix with the flat beater, adding the remaining water gradually. Knead for about 4 minutes, or until the mixture is stretchy and homogeneous.</li>
<li>Add the salt and knead again for 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Cover the dough and let it rise for 2h30, at room temperature and away from drafts.</li>
<li>In a deep skillet, heat a large volume of oil over medium heat.</li>
<li>To form the donut balls, dip the hand in cold water, hold a piece of dough in the hand. Press it between the thumb and forefinger, and let a small ball of dough slowly drop in the hot oil.</li>
<li>Renew the process until all the dough is used.</li>
<li>Deep-fry the donuts on both sides until golden brown.</li>
<li>Drain on paper towels.</li>
<li>Serve hot.</li>
