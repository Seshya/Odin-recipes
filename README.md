# odin-recipes

This is my first Odin project. It consist in building a basic recipes website. At this point, the website will be coded only in HTML by using all the knowledge that I have learned till know. 
I'm going to use the HTML boilerplate,add headings, paragraphs, unordered and ordered lists, images, absolute and or relative links and and Git.
